<#def DESCR>
The <a href="/download">first beta release of Coq 8.5</a> is available for
testing. The 8.5 version brings several major features to Coq:

<ul>
<li>asynchronous edition of documents under CoqIDE to keep working on a proof
  while Coq checks the depencies in the background;</li>
<li>universe polymorphism making it possible to reuse the same definitions at
  various universe levels;</li>
<li>primitive projections improving space and time efficiency of records, and
  adding eta-conversion for records;</li>
 <li>a new tactic engine allowing dependent subgoals, fully backtracking tactics,
  as well as tactics which can consider multiple goals together;</li>
<li>a new reduction procedure called <tt>native_compute</tt> to evaluate terms
  using the OCaml native compiler, for proofs with large computational
  steps.</li>
</ul>

More information about the changes from 8.4 to 8.5 can be found in
the <a href="/distrib/V8.5beta1/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file. Feedback and
<a href="/bugs">bug reports</a> are extremely welcome. Enjoy!
