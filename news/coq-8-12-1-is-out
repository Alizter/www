<p>We are happy to announce the <a
href="https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.12.1">release of Coq
8.12.1</a>.

<p>This release contains numerous bug fixes and documentation improvements. Some bug fix highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polymorphic side-effects inside monomorphic definitions were incorrectly handled as not inlined. This allowed deriving an inconsistency.
<li>Regression in error reporting after SSReflect's <code>case</code> tactic. A generic error message "Could not fill dependent hole in apply" was reported for any error following <code>case</code> or <code>elim</code>.
<li>Several bugs with <code>Search</code>.
<li>The <code>details</code> environment introduced in coqdoc in Coq 8.12 can now be used as advertised in the reference manual.
<li>View menu "Display parentheses" introduced in CoqIDE in Coq 8.12 now works correctly.
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/changes.html#changes-in-8-12-1">changelog</a> for details and a more complete list.</p>
