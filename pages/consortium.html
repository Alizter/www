<p>The objective of the Consortium is to make the community of users feel empowered with respect to
    the future of the Coq system, giving them opportunities to see how the system will evolve, where it is
    going, and to take an active part in this process. On the one hand, we wish to establish <strong>transparent
    ways of contributing financially and technically</strong> to the development of the system; on the other
    hand we wish to make sure that the <strong>most pressing needs of the user community are addressed
    efficiently</strong> by providing a fantastic working environment to competent developers.</p>

<p>The Coq Consortium is hosted by Inria (the French national institute for
research in digital science and technology), one of the main actors behind
the development of Coq.</p>

<div class="frameworkcontent">
    <p>Academic users can subscribe a package of support services:
        <ul>
            <li>Premium support for bugs. Reports will be
            processed in priority by the Consortium engineers. </li>
            <li>A session of on-site training each year. (Optional, travel and lodging expenses should be paid
                by the member).</li>
            <li>Integration of client code in regression tests.</li>
            <li>Privileged access to Coq developers via a dedicated mailing list.</li>
            <li>Advertisement of the member’s involvement in the Coq community.</li>
        </ul>


    </p>
    <p>Partners declare a number of intensive users of Coq they represent, and the Consortium recommends a corresponding level of
        service (a number of engineer hours, which can be used for support or training). The cost corresponds to that specific level of service.</p>
