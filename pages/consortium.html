<p>The objective of the Consortium is to make the community of users feel empowered with respect to
    the future of the Coq system, giving them opportunities to see how the system will evolve, where it is
    going, and to take an active part in this process. On the one hand, we wish to establish <strong>transparent
    ways of contributing financially and technically</strong> to the development of the system; on the other
    hand we wish to make sure that the <strong>most pressing needs of the user community are addressed
    efficiently</strong> by providing a fantastic working environment to competent developers.</p>

<div class="frameworklabel">Support services</div>
<div class="frameworkcontent">
    <p>The Consortium provides a package of support services:
        <ul>
            <li>Premium support for bugs. Reports by Consortium members will be processed in priority by
the Consortium engineers. Private bug reports can be processed by Consortium engineers
                under an NDA to explore a code base and minimize a bug example.</li>
            <li>A session of on-site training each year. (Optional, travel and lodging expenses should be paid
                by the member).</li>
            <li>Integration of some code from members in regression tests.</li>
            <li>Privileged access to Coq developers via a dedicated mailing list.</li>
            <li>Advertisement of the member’s involvement in the Coq community.</li>
        </ul>


    </p>
    <p>Partners declare a number of intensive users of Coq they represent, and the Consortium recommends a corresponding level of
        service (a number of engineer hours, which can be used for support or training). The cost corresponds to that specific level of service. Academic members receive a 50% discount.</p>

    <p>Beside these services, the Consortium can establish contracts with members to audit code and emit
a quality label if the audit is successful. The Consortium can also certify Coq related services like
        training and support provided by members.</p>
