Subject: Call for proposals: The 5th Coq Workshop

================================================================================
The Fifth Coq Workshop (2013)
http://coq.inria.fr/coq-workshop/2013
Colocated with the 4rd International Conference on Interactive Theorem 
Proving (ITP 2013)
Rennes, France
================================================================================

The Coq Workshop series brings together Coq users, developers, and 
contributors.  While conferences like ITP provide a venue for 
traditional research papers, the Coq Workshop focuses on strengthening 
the Coq community and providing a forum for discussing practical issues, 
including the future of the Coq software and its associated ecosystem of 
libraries and tools.  Thus, the workshop will be organized around 
informal presentations and discussions, likely supplemented with invited 
talks.

We invite all members of the Coq community to propose informal talks, 
discussion sessions, or any potential uses of the day allocated to the 
workshop.  Relevant subject matter includes but is not limited to:

     * Language or tactic features
     * Theory and implementation of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
     * Applications and experience in education and industry
     * Tools and platforms built on Coq
     * Plugins and libraries for Coq
     * Interfacing with Coq
     * Formalization tricks and Coq pearls

Authors should submit short proposals through EasyChair.  Submissions 
should be in portable document format (PDF).  Proposals should not 
exceed 2 pages in length in single-column full-page style.

This year, we are open to many ideas on how to use the workshop time.  
Some suggestions to drive proposals include sessions on tool 
demonstrations or lessons learned from teaching Coq.

Venue: ITP, Rennes.
Important Dates:

     * April 7: Deadline for proposal submission
     * April 28: Acceptance notification
     * July 22: Workshop in Rennes
