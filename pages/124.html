<p><a href="/coq-workshop">The Coq Workshop</a> series brings together Coq users, developers, and contributors.</p>
<p>  While conferences usually provide a venue for traditional research papers, the Coq Workshop focuses on strengthening the Coq community and providing a forum for discussing practical issues, including the future of the Coq software and its associated ecosystem of libraries and tools.  Thus, the workshop will be organized around informal presentations and discussions, supplemented with invited talks.</p>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
<p>We invite all members of the Coq community to propose informal talks, discussion sessions, or any potential uses of the day allocated to the workshop.  Relevant subject matter includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language or tactic features</li>
<li>Theory and implementation of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions</li>
<li>Applications and experience in education and industry</li>
<li>Tools and platforms built on Coq</li>
<li>Plugins and libraries for Coq</li>
<li>Interfacing with Coq</li>
<li>Formalization tricks and Coq pearls</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors should submit short proposals through <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coq4">EasyChair</a>.  Submissions should be an extended abstract of 1-2 pages in portable document format (PDF).  Submission is via <a href="">COQ7 EasyChair</a>.</p>

<p>This Coq workshop will be associated with the <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/cocorico/CoqCodingSprint/CoqCS1">Coq Coding Sprint</a>, so it will be a particular good occasion to meet developers of the system.
