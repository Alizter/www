<p>Coq implements a program specification and mathematical higher-level language called <em>Gallina</em> that is based on an expressive formal language called the <em>Calculus of Inductive Constructions</em> that itself combines both a higher-order logic and a richly-typed functional programming language. Through a <em>vernacular</em> language of commands, Coq allows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>to define functions or predicates, that can be evaluated efficiently;</li>
      <li>to state mathematical theorems and software specifications;</li>
      <li>to interactively develop formal proofs of these theorems;</li>
      <li>to machine-check these proofs by a relatively small certification "kernel";</li>
      <li>to extract certified programs to languages like OCaml, Haskell or Scheme.</li>
    </ul>

   <p>As a proof development system, Coq provides interactive proof
    methods, decision and semi-decision
    algorithms, and a <em>tactic</em> language for letting the user define its own proof methods. Connection with external computer algebra system or theorem provers is available.</p>

    <p> As a platform for the formalization of mathematics or the development of programs, Coq provides support for high-level notations, implicit contents and various other useful kinds of macros.</p>

    <p>Coq is the result of more than 30 years of research. It started in
    1984 from an implementation of the Calculus of Constructions at
    INRIA-Rocquencourt by Thierry Coquand and GÃ©rard Huet. In 1991,
    Christine Paulin extended it to the Calculus of Inductive
    Constructions.

    All in all, more than 200 people have contributed to the
    development of Coq. The <a href="/coq-team.html">Coq Team</a>
    is responsible for the development of Coq and integration of contributions.
    See <a href="<#CURRENTCREDITSURL>">credits</a> for a detailed list
