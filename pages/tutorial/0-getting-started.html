<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span> is a Proof Assistant for a Logical Framework known as the Calculus
of Inductive Constructions. It allows the interactive construction of
formal proofs, and also the manipulation of functional programs 
consistently with their specifications. It runs as a computer program
on many architectures.</p><p>It is available with a variety of user interfaces. The present
document does not attempt to present a comprehensive view of all the
possibilities of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span>, but rather to present in the most elementary
manner a tutorial on the basic specification language, called Gallina,
in which formal axiomatisations may be developed, and on the main
proof tools. For more advanced information, the reader could refer to
the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span> Reference Manual or the <span style="font-style:italic">Coq’Art</span>, a book by Y.
Bertot and P. Castéran on practical uses of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span> system.</p><p>Instructions on installation procedures, as well as more comprehensive
documentation, may be found in the standard distribution of <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span>,
which may be obtained from <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span> web site
<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/"><span style="font-family:monospace">https://coq.inria.fr/</span></a><sup><a id="text2" href="#note2">1</a></sup>.
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span> is distributed together with a graphical user interface called
CoqIDE. Alternative interfaces exist such as
Proof General<sup><a id="text3" href="#note3">2</a></sup>.</p><p>In the following examples, lines preceded by the prompt <code>Coq &lt; </code>
represent user input, terminated by a period.
The following lines usually show <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span>’s answer.
When used from a graphical user interface such as
CoqIDE, the prompt is not displayed: user input is given in one window
and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Coq</span>’s answers are displayed in a different window.</p>
