<h3>Call for papers</h3>

The Coq workshop will bring together Coq users, developers and
contributors. The workshop will be organized from submitted papers,
invited talks and a plenary discussion on the evolution and design of
Coq. Topics for submitting a paper include:

<li>Theory and implementation of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions</li>
<li>Applications and experience in education and industry</li>
<li>Tools, platforms built on Coq</li>

Authors should send their papers to Hugo.Herbelin@inria.fr. Submitted
papers should be in (postscript or) portable document format. Papers
should not exceed 12 pages in length in single-column full-page 11pt A4

If there is sufficient demand, we will try to organize a time slot for

proposal.
