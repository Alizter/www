<p>Coq is a formal proof management system: a proof done with Coq is mechanically checked by the machine. In particular, Coq allows:

    <ul>
      <li>to define functions or predicates,</li>
      <li>to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,</li>
      <li>to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,</li>
      <li>to check these proofs by a relatively small certification "kernel".</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Coq also integrates a functional programming language:

    <ul>
    <li>functions and predicates can be evaluated efficiently,</li>
    <li>a modular development system allows the reuse of theories,</li>
    <li>certified programs can be automatically extracted to languages
       like Objective Caml, Haskell or Scheme.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    <p> Coq is based on a framework called "Calculus of Inductive
    Constructions" that is both a logic and a functional programming
    language.</p>

    <p>As a proof development system, Coq provides both interactive proof
    methods and various certified decision and semi-decision
    algorithms. It provides a protocol for connecting with external
    computer algebra system or theorem provers.</p>

    <p> As a platform for the formalization of mathematics, Coq provides
    support for light notations and implicit contents. It also
    provides some support for reasoning on algebraic structures.</p>

<div class="frameworkcontent">

    <p> Coq comes with libraries for efficient arithmetics in N, Z and Q,
    libraries about lists, finite sets and finite maps, libraries on
    abstract sets, relations, classical analysis, etc.</p>

    <p> Coq is released with:</p>
      <ul>

      <li>a graphical user interface based on gtk (CoqIde) (<a
    href="coqide/index.html">see screenshots</a>),</li>
      <li>documentation tools (<tt>coqdoc</tt> and <tt>coq-tex</tt>),</li>
      <li>dependency and makefile generation tools for Coq
	(<tt>coq_makefile</tt> and <tt>coqdep</tt>),</li>
      <li>support for use from the <a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Proof General</a> Emacs mode and from <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/pcoq">Pcoq</a>.</li>

      </ul>

    <p>Coq is the result of more than 20 years of research. It started in
    1984 from an implementation of the Calculus of Constructions at
    INRIA-Rocquencourt by Thierry Coquand and Gérard Huet. In 1991,
    Christine Paulin extended it to the Calculus of Inductive
    Constructions. The system then grew from the efforts of Chet
    Murthy, Jean-Christophe Filliâtre, Bruno Barras and Hugo Herbelin.
    More than thirty other people contributed to the development of
    specific features.</p>

    <p>The development is today coordinated by the <a
    href="http://logical.inria.fr/">LogiCal</a> project
    with large contributions also coming from the <a
    href="http://proval.inria.fr/">ProVal</a> and
    <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/marelle"
   >Marelle</a> projects (see our <a
    href="doc/CREDITS">credits</a> file and the <a
    href="doc/Reference-Manual002.html">credits</a> chapter in the Coq
    Reference Manual).</p>


    <p> Coq is written in the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/"
   >Objective Caml</a> language (with a bit of C) and uses the <a
    href="http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/">Camlp4</a>
    pre-processor-pretty-printer for Objective Caml. Coq is
    distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence Version
    2.1 (LGPL).</p>
