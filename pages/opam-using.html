<h2>What is opam?</h2>

<p>Opam is the package manager for the OCaml programming language, the language
in which Coq is implemented.
Opam 2 is the recommended version, and is assumed below.
Instructions on
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html">how to install opam</a>
itself are available on the opam website.
The following command displays the version of opam you have installed:</p>

<pre><code># Make sure opam version is 2.0.0 or above.
opam --version
</code></pre>

<p>Follow the instructions below to install the last stable version of Coq and
additional packages. The instructions target an opam newcomer.</p>

<h2>Initializing opam</h2>

<p>Once opam is installed, it must be initialized before first usage:</p>

<pre><code>opam init
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

<p><code>opam init</code> will prompt you to allow opam to set up
initialization scripts, which is generally fine to accept. Otherwise, every
time a new shell is opened you have to type in the
<code>eval $(opam env)</code> command above to update environment variables.</p>

<p>By default, opam will use the global installation of OCaml. You can initialize
opam with an explicit compiler version, for example <#OCAMLV>, with the option
<code>--compiler=ocaml-base-compiler.<#OCAMLV></code>.
See also the section "Managing different versions of OCaml and Coq" below,
about switches and roots.
</p>

<h2>Installing Coq</h2>

<p>Depending on your operating system, installing Coq using opam
may require you to first install some system packages. The recommended way to determine
the names of required system packages is via the <code>opam-depext</code> tool:</p>

<pre><code>opam install opam-depext
opam-depext coq
</code></pre>

<p>For example, on Debian / Ubuntu, this command may list the <code>m4</code> system
package, which can then be installed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install m4
</code></pre>

<p>Note that installing Coq using opam will build it from sources,
which will take several minutes to complete:</p>

<pre><code># Pin the coq package to version <#CURRENTVERSION> and install it.
opam pin add coq <#CURRENTVERSION>
</code></pre>

<p>Pinning prevents opam from upgrading Coq automatically, which may cause
inadvertent breakage in your Coq projects. You can upgrade Coq explicitly to
<code>$NEW_VERSION</code> with essentially the same command:</p>

<pre><code>opam pin add coq $NEW_VERSION
</code></pre>

<p>To ensure that installation was successful, check that <code>coqc -v</code>
prints the expected version of Coq.</p>

<h3>Installing CoqIDE</h3>

<p>You may also want to install CoqIDE. Note that this requires GTK+
development files (<code>gtksourceview3</code>) to be available on the
system. As for Coq, names of system packages to install can be
determined using <code>opam-depext</code>:</p>

<pre><code>opam-depext coqide</code></pre>

<p>After the listed system packages have been installed, CoqIDE can be
built and installed with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>opam install coqide
</code></pre>

<p>There exist many <a href="/user-interfaces.html">alternative user
interfaces / editor extensions</a> for Coq.  See their respective
websites for instructions on how to install them.</p>

<h2>Using opam to install Coq packages</h2>

<p>Coq packages live in a repository separate from the standard OCaml opam
repository. The following command adds that repository to the current
opam switch (more on switches below):</p>

<pre><code>opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
</code></pre>

<p>The following command lists the names of all Coq packages along with short
descriptions:</p>

<pre><code>opam search coq
</code></pre>

<p>You can access a more detailed description of a package, say <code>coq-sudoku</code>,
using the command:</p>

<pre><code>opam show coq-sudoku
</code></pre>

<p>You can then install the package using the command:</p>

<pre><code>opam install coq-sudoku
</code></pre>

<h2>Managing different versions of OCaml and Coq</h2>

<p>By default, opam will use the global OCaml installation. Opam can handle
different versions of OCaml and other packages (including Coq) via
<em>switches</em> or <em>roots</em>.</p>

<h3>Switches</h3>

<p>Switches provide separate environments, with their own versions of OCaml and
installed packages.</p>

<p>The following command creates a switch named <code>with-coq</code> with OCaml
<#OCAMLV>:</p>

<pre><code># Run one of the following depending on your version of opam
opam switch create with-coq <#OCAMLV>
</code></pre>

<p>Change to an existing switch named <code>other-switch</code> with this command:</p>

<pre><code>opam switch other-switch
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

<h3>Roots</h3>

<p>Opam stores all its configuration (including switches) in a directory called
<em>root</em> (by default, <code>~/.opam</code>). The path to the root can be
set using the <code>$OPAMROOT</code> environment variable, providing an
alternative way of creating fresh opam environments.
</p>

<p>The main benefit of roots is that they can be used simultaneously, but they
require some external bookkeeping. In comparison. switches are entirely managed
by opam, and they can share the global configuration of a single root.
</p>

<pre><code># Set a new root location
export OPAMROOT=~/.opam-coq.<#CURRENTVERSION>

# Initialize the root with an explicit OCaml version.

opam init -n --compiler=ocaml-base-compiler.<#OCAMLV>

# Install Coq in this new root (same commands as above)
opam pin add coq <#CURRENTVERSION>
</code></pre>

<p>Every time a new shell is opened, or you want to use a different root, type
in the following lines:
</p>

<pre><code>export OPAMROOT=~/.opam-coq.<#CURRENTVERSION>
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>
